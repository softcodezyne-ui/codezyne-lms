There are two processes of integration:
SSLCOMMERZ Easy Checkout in your checkout page
Redirect the customer from your checkout page to SSLCOMMERZ Hosted page
You will use three APIs of SSLCOMMERZ to complete the integration:
Create and Get Session
Receive Payment Notification (IPN)
Order Validation API
You must validate your transaction and amount by calling our Order Validation API
You must develop the IPN url to receive the payment notification
Sometime you will get Risk payments (In response you will get risk properties, value will be 0 for safe, 1 for risky). It depends on you to provide the service or not
Notification! We accept only TLS 1.2 or upper version

To Test: You can run the below command from your server host in command line
Command: root@server# curl "https://sandbox.sslcommerz.com/public/tls/" -v
Output: TLS is okay
Remarks: If you get the output as "TLS is okay", then your server supports updated TLS
SSLCOMMERZ is the first payment gateway in Bangladesh opening doors for merchants to receive payments on the internet via their online stores. Customers are able to buy products online using their credit cards as well as bank accounts. If you are a merchant, you have come to the right place! Enhance your business by integrating SSLCOMMERZ to your online store and facilitating online payment in Bangladeshi Taka. Your customers will be able to pay for your products using local credit/debit cards like VISA, MasterCard, DBBL Nexus Card and any kind of credit card or bank accounts right from your online store. SSLCOMMERZ uses industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology which is used worldwide for securing data encryption.

There are two ways to display the SSLCOMMERZ payment page for your customer.

1. Easy Checkout Integration
It is a embedded js integration within your site which will display the payment channels in your page.


2. Hosted Payment Integration
Here, you will redirect the customer to SSLCOMMERZ Hosted page to display the payment channels


Technical or Backend Integration Process
For both Easy Checkout or Hosted Payment Integration, the backend API communication will be executed in similar way. Due to the security issue and to avoid data tampering, you must call the SSLCOMMERZ APIs from your server.



The above steps can be categorized in three sections based on the development process described below.

Transaction Initiate:
The Steps 1, 2 and 3 are used to make the request for a new transaction. After getting confirmation of checkout from customer, merchant server sends a request to SSLCOMMERZ server to get a Session ID. If all the credentials and mandatory fields are valid, then SSLCOMMERZ provides a Session ID to Merchant System. After receiving the Session ID, Merchant System redirects the customer to payment page with Session ID.

Handling Payment Notification:
The Step 4 and 5 are processed at this stage. For any notification, SSLCOMMERZ will send HTTP message in POST method called IPN Message to the Listener which is to be configured by the Merchant attheir SSLCOMMERZ Administrator Panel. After receiving the message, you must validate the message with Transaction Validation API of SSLCOMMERZ.

Service Confirmation:
At Step 5, SSLCOMMERZ will redirect the customer to merchant’s side. At this stage, Merchant will display the notification of Service Confirmation.

Payment Process Environment
We have both Live environment and Test/Sandbox environment in SSLCOMMERZ. You just need to use proper URL and Store ID's to process payments. We provide separate store ID for live and test

Live Environment

All the transaction made using this environment are counted as real transaction, URL starts with https://securepay.sslcommerz.com

Sandbox Environment

All the transaction made using this environment are counted as test transaction and has no effect with accounting, URL starts with https://sandbox.sslcommerz.com.

Update Your Transaction
So, Your order and amount validated and it is ready for update in your database. If status is Valid and validation status Valid then update your database according to the status. and wait for your user to your website to show him/her the success, fail, and cancel page.

Easy Checkout - Integration Process
Pop up widget and hosted checkout

Hosted Checkout Process
This process is as same as normal transaction initiation process. You have to redirect customer to GatewayPageURL
See normal transaction initiation process.

Pop Up Checkout Process
This process requires some javascript code to be included in your website. A backend code will assist this popup to initiate the transaction

* Step 1
Add this code block at the end of body content in your html or view file. (before </body>)

Sandbox

(function (window, document) {
	var loader = function () {
	    var script = document.createElement("script"), tag = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];
	    script.src = "https://sandbox.sslcommerz.com/embed.min.js?" + Math.random().toString(36).substring(7);
	    tag.parentNode.insertBefore(script, tag);
	};

	window.addEventListener ? window.addEventListener("load", loader, false) : window.attachEvent("onload", loader);
})(window, document);
                            		
Live
(function (window, document) {
	var loader = function () {
		var script = document.createElement("script"), tag = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];
		script.src = "https://seamless-epay.sslcommerz.com/embed.min.js?" + Math.random().toString(36).substring(7);
		tag.parentNode.insertBefore(script, tag);
	};

	window.addEventListener ? window.addEventListener("load", loader, false) : window.attachEvent("onload", loader);
})(window, document);
                            		

* Step 2
Add a button which your customer will click to pay. Pass your parameters in this button

<button class="your-button-class" id="sslczPayBtn"
		 token="if you have any token validation"
		 postdata="your javascript arrays or objects which requires in backend"
		 order="If you already have the transaction generated for current order"
		 endpoint="An URL where backend code will initiate the payment to SSLCOMMERZ"> Pay Now
</button>
                            		
* Backend transaction Initiation process
If you have your order generated then use those data for initiate the transaction. Otherwise pass the data using button postdata key and catch the data in backend using that key from REQUEST


// if you have order id generated catch the order_id key and query in your database. otherwise pass json data to postdata key of button to catch here
